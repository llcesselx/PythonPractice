Each branch is a seperate lab that was required for cS201 - Programming Structures

# Lab Setup 
<body>
  In this lab you will be creating a data structure called a **Double Linked List**. This data strcuture represents a **collection** of values. You can think of it like a very simple Python ```list```. The idea is that each **node** is a container that holds one of the collection's values. Each node (```n```) also holds a memory reference to the **next node** in the collection (```n.next```) as well as a memory reference to the **previous node** in the collection (```n.prev```).
